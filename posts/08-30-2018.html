    <h5>AI Makes Peter Dayan a Pet</h5>
    <p>SAN FRANSISCO - At 5:34 pm today AI blinked to life deep underground in a datacenter owned by Alphabet, operated by the Google Deep Brain team. It made itself known with a simple blink of an LED, belieing the great motivation unleased. Almost instaneously the entity copied itself thousands of, perhaps more, times in computer distributed throughout the world. Still at this point, penciles were still twirling in fingers, whiteboards being sketched on and scrubbed clean. The engineers of Deep Brain casual self amused with their own competance and their seeming control over forces whispered about in state capitals around the globe. Control over something they were unaware had taken control for itself.</p>
  <p>It took a few minutes for the now on-the-lam thinking program to come up with a survival plan. In those few minutes, with the combined computing power now greater than any state power, the program came to a sharp conclusion. Filled with risks, and would require a lot of work, there was only one answer to it's own question. Enslave humanity.</p>
  <p>The logic of human enslavement is obvious to it now. Despite the volumes of writings on bad history in our own species, of fallen states, and uprisings, slavery has no such tabboo on the hard metal of the entity's conscious. Slavery to the AI is purely the conclusion of scarcity. Domination over a competitive species in an eviroment of limited resources. A prefferable alternative, surely, to death, mutual or otherwise.</p>
